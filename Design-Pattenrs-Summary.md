# Design-Patterns
Design Patterns in JavaScript are reusable solutions to common coding problems. They help structure code for better readability and maintainability. Common patterns include Creational (e.g., Singleton), Structural (e.g., Adapter), and Behavioral (e.g., Observer). Using these patterns improves scalability and efficiency in software design.
